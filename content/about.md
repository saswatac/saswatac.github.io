---------------------------

I am a Software engineer at [Neural Concept](https://neuralconcept.com), a start up based out of the Computer Vision Lab at EPFL. Our company works on building 3D Deep Learning 
models that learn to predict values of physical simulations based on the input shape geometries.
I am working on building a scalable framework to train and interact with the deep learning models.

I have over 6 years of experience in software development and data science. Previously,
I worked in the AI Platforms team at AWS, New York where I helped build machine learning algorithms on AWS Sagemaker, 
a fully-managed platform that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy 
machine learning models at any scale.

Prior to that I worked for the Financial Intelligence Systems team in the Amazon retail organization, where i helped build a custom BI application that analyzed data at scale 
from different sources such as catalog, inventory, forecasting, ordering and shipment, 
and provided users with key business metrics. 

I am a generalist and over the years have worked on multiple things across the stack- asynchronous event processing workflows, 
back end web services, web application apis, data pipelines for ETL, benchmarking and 
performance analysis of machine learning algorithms. My language of choice is Java and Python.

I graduated with a masters degree in Systems Sciences and Automation from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2012. As a part of my
master's thesis I worked on stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning. I completed my bachelors from the Department of Electrical
Engineering, Jadavpur University in 2010.
