Event driven system architectures have become become really popular in the last decade. It is at the heart of high performance web servers such as NGINX. The good performance of Node.js can be credited to its asynchronous event driven runtime. There are reactive programming frameworks such as RxJava available today which helps developers build event driven systems. So what is this event driven paradigm and how does it help bring efficiency?</description></item><item><title>An interactive dashboard for Indian Parliament statistics using Dash</title><link>https://saswatac.github.io/posts/an-interactive-dashboard-for-indian-parliament-statistics-using-dash/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 20:56:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://saswatac.github.io/posts/an-interactive-dashboard-for-indian-parliament-statistics-using-dash/</guid><description>(Cross posted, originally on medium https://medium.com/@saswatachakravarty/74a6dbb35ecc)

Our company works on building 3D Deep Learning models that learn to predict values of physical simulations based on the input shape geometries. I am working on building a scalable framework to train and interact with the deep learning models.
I have over 6 years of experience in software development and data science.</description></item></channel></rss>
